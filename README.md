# RMB-titanomagnetite

The Rock Magnetic Bestiary (RMB) is a curated collection of rock magnetic data developed at the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) focused on well-characterized synthetic and natural materials. Inspired by medieval bestiaries that cataloged natural entities through allegorical descriptions, the Rock Magnetic Bestiary aims to facilitate the interpretation of the magnetic properties of natural samples by comparison with detailed reference datasets.

This repository contains data from the titanomagnetite portion of the Rock Magnetic Bestiary (RMB Minerals â€” RMB titanomagnetite).
